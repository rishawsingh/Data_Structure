1. Missing number in array 
Easy Accuracy: 42.51% Submissions: 98248 Points: 2
Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}
Output: 9

Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106



## Solution

class Solution:
    def MissingNumber(self,array,n):
        # miss is to find total no. of elments in an array 
        miss = len(array)+1
        # work the formula n*(n+1)/2
        sum= (miss*(miss+1))//2
        #initialize s=0
        s=0
        for i in array:
            s=s+i
        result=sum-s    
        return result
